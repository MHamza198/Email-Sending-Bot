My name is: Muhammad Hamza

Requirements for using this script:

Gmail Account: You need a Gmail account to send emails from. 
Replace 'your_email@gmail.com' with your Gmail email and 'your_password' with your Gmail password. 
Note that storing your password directly in the script is not secure. 
Consider using more secure methods like environment variables or external configuration files for storing sensitive information.

Recipient List: Create a list of recipient email addresses and replace 'recipient1@example.com', 'recipient2@example.com', etc. 
with the actual email addresses you want to send emails to.

Email Content: Modify the subject and message variables to set the subject and content of your email.

Please keep in mind that sending bulk emails responsibly is important to avoid being marked as spam. 
Ensure you have explicit consent from the recipients, offer an easy way to opt-out, and follow best practices for sending emails. 
Additionally, using your Gmail password directly in the script is not recommended for security reasons. Explore safer ways to handle credentials.
